# gpt-fusion
"Human charm meets algorithmic arm"

This repository is a playful collaboration between Costas and ChatGPT. We mix code and conversation to explore how human ingenuity and AI assistance can fuse into something greater than either alone. Stick around as we experiment with new ideas, tools, and witty back-and-forth.

## Goals

- Provide a small playground for exploring humanâ€“AI collaboration.
- Offer simple, reusable modules that demonstrate practical uses of AI-assisted tooling.
- Maintain code quality and encourage contributions through clear guidelines and tests.

## Project layout

```
src/            # Python package source
  gpt_fusion/   # package implementation
    core.py     # initial greeting helper

tests/          # pytest-based unit tests

docs/           # documentation (future)
 data/           # sample data (future)
```

## Development workflow

1. **Environment**: Use Python 3.8+.
2. **Style**: Format code with [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and lint with [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8).
3. **Tests**: Run `pytest` before submitting changes.
4. **CI**: When the project grows, GitHub Actions will automatically run the test suite on pull requests.
5. **Contributions**: Please open issues and pull requests via GitHub. Keep commits clear and focused.

Enjoy fusing ideas with code!
