# Unity Prototype

This directory contains a very simple starting point for a Unity project. It is meant as a placeholder to demonstrate how Unity and C# files can be organized within this repository.

To use this code:

1. Create a new Unity project (tested with Unity 2021 or later).
2. Copy the `Assets` folder from this directory into your Unity project.
3. Open the project in Unity to continue development.

The included `PlayerController` script shows a basic example of handling keyboard input to move a player character.
