### Phase 9: Final Testing

#### Test Basic Functionality
1. **Hit Play**
2. **Test Movement** - WASD should move player
3. **Test Collecting** - Walk into coffee cups
4. **Test Achievements** - Should unlock "Baby Steps", "First Caffeine Fix"
5. **Test Pause** - ESC should pause game

#### Debug Common Issues
- **Player falls through floor**: Add Rigidbody to player, check CharacterController
- **Collectibles don't trigger**: Ensure they have trigger colliders
- **No achievements**: Check AchievementSystem has popup prefab assigned
- **Can't move**: Ensure player has CharacterController, not Rigidbody

## ðŸŽ® You're Done!

Once set up, you'll have:
- âœ… Playable office environment
- âœ… Coffee cup collection gameplay
