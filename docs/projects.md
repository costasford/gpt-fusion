# Projects

The repository hosts a few small demos showcasing different aspects of human‑AI collaboration. This page summarises each component and links to further details.

## Python utilities

The `gpt_fusion` package provides greeting helpers, math functions and simple CSV readers used throughout the tutorials. See the [package README](../README.md#project-layout) for an overview.

## Auth UI Kit

A Tailwind‑styled login form powered by Firebase. Update `auth-ui-kit/app.js` with your project credentials and serve the folder locally to experiment with email/password and Google sign in flows.

## Unity prototype

A basic 3D scene demonstrating player movement, item pickups and simple enemy AI. Copy the `Assets` directory from `unity-prototype/` into a new Unity project (Unity 2021 or later).

## Tutorial

Walk through loading the sample dataset and computing averages in [tutorial.md](tutorial.md).
