Welcome to **GPT Fusion**, a small playground for blending human creativity with AI tooling. Explore the projects below to see what we're experimenting with.

## Quickstart

New to the repo? See the [main README](https://github.com/costasford/gpt-fusion#readme) for setup details. In
short, clone the project, run `pytest` to verify the Python utilities and then
open the demos described below.

These small examples feed into one another. The Python helpers can power the
login form or provide data for the Unity prototype. Throughout the docs you'll
see how tests and tutorials tie the components together.

## Projects

### Python utilities

Reusable helpers for greetings, math and simple CSV analysis. [Read the docs](README.md).

### Auth UI Kit

Tailwind CSS login form using Firebase. [View the demo](https://github.com/costasford/gpt-fusion/tree/main/auth-ui-kit).
